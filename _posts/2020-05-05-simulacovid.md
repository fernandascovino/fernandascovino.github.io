The simulator was built to assist the decision making of public managers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, foreseeing the overload of the capacity of hospital resources. We adapted the SEIR model from [Alison Hill (2020)](https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/) and used the data from Brazilian states' daily reports collected by [Brasil.IO volunteers (including me!)](https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/boletim), and [DataSUS municipal health resources](http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/deftohtm.exe?cnes/cnv/equipobr.def). 

This project is one of many tools of the [CoronaCidades initiative](https://coronacidades.org/), by Impulso-gov and partners, to guide municipality's policies with the advancement of Covid-19 - and it couldn't be done without the help of volunteers, including Jo√£o Carabetta, Ana Paula Pellegrino, Diego Oliveira, Gabriel Saruhashi and Luiz Felipe Costa. The project is still ongoing - and hopefully, it will serve good in this time of need.
