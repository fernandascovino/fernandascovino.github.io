This project is being developed by [LAB.ipp](https://www.labipp.com.br/), a students' organization from FGV-Rio who believes that, with great evidence, we can improve the public sector; in collaboration with prof. Carlos Ragazzo, our partner from Todos pela Educação. Our goal is to understand what could be related to the differences in students' performance during primary school in Rio de Janeiro city. We analyzed the evolution of students' scores at school level from 2005 to 2011 modeling the top and bottom schools based on their performance evolution. 

By crossing socioeconomic and geolocalized data, we discovered there was top performance schools nearby the a lot of the bottom schools within the similar socioeconomics levels. With that, we are trying to investigate what inside school actions can differenciate those schools performances, to drawn best practices that can be shared in their network.
